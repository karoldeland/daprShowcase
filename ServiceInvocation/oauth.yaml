    # "0" means to auto-detect which authentication
    # style the provider wants by trying both ways and caching
    # the successful way for the future.

    # "1" sends the "client_id" and "client_secret"
    # in the POST body as application/x-www-form-urlencoded parameters.

    # "2" sends the client_id and client_password
    # using HTTP Basic Authorization. This is an optional style
    # described in the OAuth2 RFC 6749 section 2.3.1.
